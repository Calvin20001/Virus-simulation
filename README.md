# Virus-simulation

MASKS DO NOT WORK IN THIS VERSION.


The simulation interval has been set to 50ms, so it is rather fast. There are no set parameters for the graph updating interval, so if you want to change it, feel free to tweak it on line 75.

Days has automatically been set to 100, this almost always ensures that the simulation will end at when everyone is completely infected (Other than people outside of the infection radius of course, quarintine).

All the other variables are self-explanatory.
